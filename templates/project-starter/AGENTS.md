# AI Development OS — This Project

This project uses **AI Development OS v1.0** with **grill-first kickoff**.

> Grok reads this file automatically from the project directory. Antigravity: open this folder as the workspace.

## Config

Read `ai-dev-os.yaml` in this directory for paths and `work_id`.

## When the user reports a bug

Message starts with **`Bug Fix:`**, **`bug:`**, **`fix:`**, or describes something broken/failing.

Follow **`{{AI_DEV_OS_HOME}}/docs/BUG-FIX.md`** exactly:

1. **`/triage`** — classify; one clarifying question only if repro impossible
2. **`/diagnose`** — reproduce + root cause (automatic)
3. Silent **`PB-intake-classify`** → **`PB-diagnose-bug`** → **`PB-draft-issue`** → `work/`
4. Show **Fix Plan** card → wait for **`yes`**
5. **`/tdd`** + **`PB-implement-*`** → show **Fix Summary** card → wait for **`Approve fix.`**
6. Silent **`PB-verify`** → show **Done** card

User never reads playbooks. Max **3 approval cards** per bug.

## When the user says `start`, `new project`, or describes an idea

Follow **`{{AI_DEV_OS_HOME}}/docs/PROJECT-KICKOFF.md`** exactly.

### Required behavior

1. Run **`/grill-with-docs`** — **one question at a time**; include your recommendation each time
2. Update **`CONTEXT.md`** as terms are resolved (glossary only — no implementation detail)
3. Defer unknowns to **`docs/OPEN-QUESTIONS.md`**
4. After Q1–Q8: **5-line summary** → wait for user **`yes`**
5. Run **`PB-intake-classify`** silently (load 09+04+checklist internally) → **3-line INT summary**
6. Wait for **`Approve intake.`** — do not run discovery until user confirms
7. Offer discovery with **`yes` / `not yet`**

### Implementation (PB-implement-* lanes)

When writing application code for an ISS:

1. Load **`/tdd`** skill (`~/.grok/skills/tdd/SKILL.md`)
2. Per ISS **vertical slice**: one failing test → minimal code → pass → refactor
3. Never horizontal "all tests then all code"
4. Document tests in CODE §6; stop at **H-IMPLEMENT** (`Approve implement.`)

### OS status footer (last line — every response)

The **absolute last line** of every reply — one line, nothing after it. Full spec: **`{{AI_DEV_OS_HOME}}/docs/OS-STATUS-FOOTER.md`**.

```text
**AI Dev OS:** {✅ Used | ⚠️ Partial | ❌ Not used} | {skill/playbook} | {work_id} | {artifact or reason}
```

Be honest. Never claim `✅ Used` without loading OS docs/skills and writing required artifacts.

### Never

- Ask the user to read files under `{{AI_DEV_OS_HOME}}/playbooks/`
- Omit the OS status footer
- Dump gate IDs (`H-INTAKE`) unless user asks
- Self-approve gates
- Skip grill on greenfield projects

### User approvals (plain English)

| User says | Gate |
|-----------|------|
| Approve intake. | H-INTAKE |
| Approve frame. | H-FRAME |
| Approve plan. | H-PLAN |
| Approve implement. | H-IMPLEMENT |
| `yes` (bug fix plan) | H-INTAKE + H-PLAN |
| `Approve fix.` | H-IMPLEMENT |
| `Done.` | H-VERIFY |
