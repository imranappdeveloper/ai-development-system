## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-18

### Frozen — AI Development OS v1.0

Platform frozen. No further architectural changes to v1.0 substrate.

### Added

- **Release bundle** `release/v1.0/`:
  - `PLATFORM-MANIFEST.md`, `VERSION-REPORT.md`, `ARCHITECTURE-REPORT.md`
  - `DEPENDENCY-GRAPH.md` + `DEPENDENCY-GRAPH.yaml`
  - `SKILL-REGISTRY.yaml`, `WORKFLOW-REGISTRY.yaml`, `STANDARDS-REGISTRY.yaml`
  - `ROADMAP-v2.md`, `FUTURE-ENHANCEMENTS.md`
- Principal Architect freeze sign-off — `FOUNDATION.md` `status: frozen`
- `spec_sha: 14d731c15af6532e` pinned in `INDEX.md`
- Repository branded **AI Development OS v1.0**

### Changed

- `ARTIFACT-REGISTRY.yaml` — PRD, ARCH, CODE, TEST-RPT → `active`
- `INDEX.md`, `README.md`, `ROADMAP.md` — v1.0 branding

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `docs/OS-STATUS-FOOTER.md` — mandatory footer on every agent reply (`✅ Used` / `⚠️ Partial` / `❌ Not used`)
- `docs/BUG-FIX.md` — simple bug path: `Bug Fix: …` → `/triage` → `/diagnose` → 3 formatted approval cards; silent OS artifacts
- Implementation flow — **`/tdd` mandatory** for all `PB-implement-*` lanes (03-workflow, 09-system-prompt, checklists, PROJECT-KICKOFF, AGENTS.md)
- Docs + scaffold output — **Grok / Antigravity** workflow (replaced Cursor-only `cursor .` steps)
- `ai-new` — idempotent setup for existing projects (create AGENTS.md/git/work only if missing; no overwrite)
- `scripts/install-cli.sh` — one-time install for `ai-new` (`~/.local/bin` symlink + optional `~/.bashrc` alias)
- `scripts/new-project.sh` — run from any folder; default scaffolds **current directory**; optional subfolder name creates `./<name>` under pwd; symlink-safe path resolution for `ai-new`
- `templates/project-starter/` — project template for new-project.sh
- `docs/PROJECT-KICKOFF.md` — grill-first flow (`/grill-with-docs` before intake; users answer questions only)
- `templates/context/OPEN-QUESTIONS-template.md` — deferred kickoff questions
- `docs/GETTING-STARTED.md` — reframed; users → PROJECT-KICKOFF, agents → playbooks
